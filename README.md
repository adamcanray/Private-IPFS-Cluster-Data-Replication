# Private IPFS Cluster for Data Replication

This repository provides a comprehensive guide and setup for building a private IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) cluster designed for secure and efficient data replication. Inspired by the insightful work at [Eleks Research](https://eleks.com/research/ipfs-network-data-replication/), this repository covers the creation of a Docker Swarm network, joining nodes to the swarm, configuring IPFS, and establishing a robust private network for enhanced data replication and distribution.

## Key Features:

- **Docker Swarm Integration**: Initiate and manage a Docker Swarm network to orchestrate IPFS nodes for improved collaboration and resource utilization.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Utilize Alpine Linux and ARM64 architecture for a lightweight and efficient containerized environment.

- **IPFS Configuration**: Configure IPFS nodes for private access, adjusting addresses, and generating the necessary swarm key for secure communication.

- **Bootstrapping IPFS Nodes**: Learn the essentials of bootstrapping IPFS nodes, ensuring efficient communication and replication within the private cluster.

- **Service Management**: Implement service management with OpenRC in Alpine Linux, converting from a systemd service to an OpenRC service.

- **Testing and Usage**: Verify the functionality of your private IPFS network by testing access to Content Identifiers (CIDs) and ensuring smooth data replication.

## Usage:

1. **Docker Swarm Initialization**:

   - Follow the instructions in [run-guide](./RUN-GUIDE.md) for initializing the Docker Swarm network.
